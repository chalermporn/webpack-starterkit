# Webpack + Babel + SASS

*This is a very basic example on how to use Webpack with Babel and SASS*

I used Vue.js as an example, you can use any JavaScript framework you like.

## Installation

You can clone this repository [from GitHub](https://github.com/woutrbe/webpack-starterkit)

Once cloned, run:

`npm install`

## Development

Run `npm run dev`

A development server will be started at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Build

Run `npm run build`

This will generate a `/build` folder with all the bundled assets.

## Webpack config

For simplicity reasons, the development and production config files are split up, you could keep everything in one file and add / remove loaders based on the environment.
